## ‚ú® About the Project

This was a beginner-level project I created to improve my soldering and hardware skills. I wanted to make something visually interesting, so I designed and built a 4x4x4 LED Cube and added a **Wi-Fi controlled animation system** using an ESP32 microcontroller.

Rather than hardcoding animation sequences or using physical buttons, the cube runs its own **web interface**. Once connected to Wi-Fi, the ESP32 prints its IP address in the serial monitor. Users can access the cube‚Äôs control panel through any browser on the same network to **select and trigger animations**.

Some animations worked well, while others were harder to make visually effective due to the small size of the cube ‚Äî but this was part of the learning process, and I‚Äôm proud of the result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- 4x4x4 LED cube built from scratch and driven by shift registers
- Powered by an **ESP32** with integrated Wi-Fi
- Built-in **web interface** to control animations in real-time
- Modular animation logic with the ability to expand
- Great practice in soldering, basic electronics, and networking

## üîí Security Note

Wi-Fi credentials are stored in a separate `WifiCredentials.h` file, which is **excluded from version control** using `.gitignore`.  
Please do the same if you fork or clone this project.

## üõë Status

This project is **not actively maintained**, but I **welcome contributions** ‚Äî especially improvements to existing animations or entirely new ones.

Feel free to fork the repo and show off your own animations!
